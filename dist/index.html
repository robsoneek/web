            <p class="p-3 max-h-96 ">The Pop Out: Ken & Friends was a one-off concert by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, on June 19, 2024. Spanning over three hours, over 25 West Coast artists were featured during the event, including opening acts DJ Hed and Mustard, Ty Dolla Sign, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy, Tyler, the Creator, Roddy Ricch, YG, Schoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and Dr. Dre. Lamar performed four of his five Drake-aimed diss tracks, "Like That", "Euphoria", "6:16 in LA" and "Not Like Us", for the first time during his headlining set; the latter track was performed five consecutive times.</p>

                <p class="p-3 max-h-96">In 2023, Drake and rapper J. Cole released "First Person Shooter", where Cole claims that he, Drake, and Lamar are the "big three" in modern hip-hop. In March 2024, Lamar dissed Drake and Cole on "Like That", proclaiming that hip-hop is "just big me". On April 5, Cole dissed Lamar on "7 Minute Drill", but later apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. Later that month, Drake dissed Lamar on "Push Ups" and "Taylor Made Freestyle".

                    Lamar dissed Drake in "Euphoria" on April 30 and "6:16 in LA" on May 3. Drake released "Family Matters" later on the 3rd, accusing Lamar of domestic abuse and alleging that one of Lamar's children was fathered by producer Dave Free. Twenty minutes later, Lamar released "Meet the Grahams", accusing Drake of sexual predation—including sex trafficking—and fathering a second secret child (rapper Pusha T revealed in a 2018 diss track that Drake was secretly fathering a son named Adonis). The following day, on "Not Like Us", Lamar more explicitly accused Drake of pedophilia. On May 5, Drake responded with "The Heart Part 6", denying Lamar's accusations and claiming that Drake's team gave Lamar false information about the secret child.</p>
