                <p class="p-3 ">In 2023, Drake and rapper J. Cole released "First Person Shooter", where Cole claims that he, Drake, and Lamar are the "big three" in modern hip-hop. In March 2024, Lamar dissed Drake and Cole on "Like That", proclaiming that hip-hop is "just big me". On April 5, Cole dissed Lamar on "7 Minute Drill", but later apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. Later that month, Drake dissed Lamar on "Push Ups" and "Taylor Made Freestyle".

                    Lamar dissed Drake in "Euphoria" on April 30 and "6:16 in LA" on May 3. Drake released "Family Matters" later on the 3rd, accusing Lamar of domestic abuse and alleging that one of Lamar's children was fathered by producer Dave Free. Twenty minutes later, Lamar released "Meet the Grahams", accusing Drake of sexual predation—including sex trafficking—and fathering a second secret child (rapper Pusha T revealed in a 2018 diss track that Drake was secretly fathering a son named Adonis). The following day, on "Not Like Us", Lamar more explicitly accused Drake of pedophilia. On May 5, Drake responded with "The Heart Part 6", denying Lamar's accusations and claiming that Drake's team gave Lamar false information about the secret child.</p>

                <p class="" id="chromakopiatext"> Chromakopia is the eighth studio album by American rapper Tyler, the Creator. It was released through Columbia Records on October 28, 2024, serving as the follow-up to Call Me If You Get Lost (2021). Chromakopia was written, produced, and arranged by Tyler himself. The album blends different genres like hip-hop, jazz, and soul, evocative of Tyler's previous releases Flower Boy (2017) and Igor (2019). Conceptually, Chromakopia is narrated by Tyler's mother, Bonita Smith, as a diary that pieces together Tyler's perspective on past timeline experiences separated by tracks. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the lyricism, cohesiveness, and production, and even noted its messy and confusing nature as a positive. Its concept was inspired by his experience growing up in Greater Los Angeles and the life lessons he learned from Smith as a child, that he began to understand and appreciate as he grew older. Before the album's release, publications speculated that the album could be based on the story of Chroma the Great, a powerful conductor whose orchestra creates the colors of the world, from the 1961 children's novel The Phantom Tollbooth. Dork's Jake Hawkes notes the character ties into the album's aesthetics, but has little impact on the lyrical material. Music critics characterized Chromakopia as an early midlife crisis album revolving around the concerns young adults have over their newfound adulthood. Its protagonist, St. Chroma, is introduced on the opening track of the same name.</p>

                    <p class=""> Chromakopia was supported by the singles "Noid" and "Sticky", as well as two promotional singles, from "St. Chroma" and "Thought I Was Dead". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in eight countries. In the United States, the album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, earning Tyler his third US number-one album and is his fastest-selling album to date. Several other songs from the album also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, such as "Noid" and "St. Chroma". In support of the album, Tyler will embark on the Chromakopia: The World Tour (2025).</p>
                    <p class="">On October 28, 2024, during Tyler, the Creator's Chromakopia exclusive listening event, Tyler revealed the meaning behind the album, noting that the album was originally about him growing up in Hawthorne, Inglewood. He revealed on stage that "no one knows anything about me from before I was like 17" and that the record turned into Tyler "taking a bunch of shit my mom told me as a kid." Tyler uploaded a video on his official YouTube channel titled "MASK IS OFF: CHROMAKOPIA" on November 12, 2024, which chronicles the creative process of the album, including behind-the-scenes clips from composition sessions, instrumentation arrangements and engineering work.</p>
