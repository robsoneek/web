                <p class="p-3 ">The Pop Out: Ken & Friends was a one-off concert by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, on June 19, 2024. Spanning over three hours, over 25 West Coast artists were featured during the event, including opening acts DJ Hed and Mustard, Ty Dolla Sign, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy, Tyler, the Creator, Roddy Ricch, YG, Schoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and Dr. Dre. Lamar performed four of his five Drake-aimed diss tracks, "Like That", "Euphoria", "6:16 in LA" and "Not Like Us", for the first time during his headlining set; the latter track was performed five consecutive times.</p>

                <p class="p-3 ">In 2023, Drake and rapper J. Cole released "First Person Shooter", where Cole claims that he, Drake, and Lamar are the "big three" in modern hip-hop. In March 2024, Lamar dissed Drake and Cole on "Like That", proclaiming that hip-hop is "just big me". On April 5, Cole dissed Lamar on "7 Minute Drill", but later apologized for the song and removed it from streaming services. Later that month, Drake dissed Lamar on "Push Ups" and "Taylor Made Freestyle".

                    Lamar dissed Drake in "Euphoria" on April 30 and "6:16 in LA" on May 3. Drake released "Family Matters" later on the 3rd, accusing Lamar of domestic abuse and alleging that one of Lamar's children was fathered by producer Dave Free. Twenty minutes later, Lamar released "Meet the Grahams", accusing Drake of sexual predation—including sex trafficking—and fathering a second secret child (rapper Pusha T revealed in a 2018 diss track that Drake was secretly fathering a son named Adonis). The following day, on "Not Like Us", Lamar more explicitly accused Drake of pedophilia. On May 5, Drake responded with "The Heart Part 6", denying Lamar's accusations and claiming that Drake's team gave Lamar false information about the secret child.</p>

                <p class="p-3"> Chromakopia is the eighth studio album by American rapper Tyler, the Creator. It was released through Columbia Records on October 28, 2024, serving as the follow-up to Call Me If You Get Lost (2021). Chromakopia was written, produced, and arranged by Tyler himself. The album blends different genres like hip-hop, jazz, and soul, evocative of Tyler's previous releases Flower Boy (2017) and Igor (2019). Conceptually, Chromakopia is narrated by Tyler's mother, Bonita Smith, as a diary that pieces together Tyler's perspective on past timeline experiences separated by tracks. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the lyricism, cohesiveness, and production, and even noted its messy and confusing nature as a positive. Its concept was inspired by his experience growing up in Greater Los Angeles and the life lessons he learned from Smith as a child, that he began to understand and appreciate as he grew older. Before the album's release, publications speculated that the album could be based on the story of Chroma the Great, a powerful conductor whose orchestra creates the colors of the world, from the 1961 children's novel The Phantom Tollbooth. Dork's Jake Hawkes notes the character ties into the album's aesthetics, but has little impact on the lyrical material. Music critics characterized Chromakopia as an early midlife crisis album revolving around the concerns young adults have over their newfound adulthood. Its protagonist, St. Chroma, is introduced on the opening track of the same name.</p>
